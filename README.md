🌟 React To-Do List App with Dynamic Theme Switching! 🌟

I’ve been working on a To-Do List Application using React that focuses on improving user productivity while providing a smooth, responsive, and visually pleasing experience. 🎨✨

🛠 Key Features:

Task Management Made Simple:
Users can easily add, delete, and track tasks in real-time, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience.

Built using React’s useState hook for efficient state management, making task updates instantaneous.

Dark/Light Mode Toggle: 🌗
One of the coolest features is the Theme Toggle. You can switch between Dark Mode for a sleek, modern interface or Light Mode for a clean, minimalistic look.
The transition between themes is smooth, leveraging state changes in React, and it remembers your preference when you return.

Responsive UI: 📱💻
Fully responsive across all device sizes, ensuring an optimized experience whether you're on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

The UI adapts gracefully, maintaining a modern, intuitive layout no matter the screen size.

User-Centric Design:
The interface was built with the user in mind—offering a distraction-free, minimalistic design that emphasizes clarity and simplicity.

The dark/light mode toggle is particularly useful in different environments—bright or dimly lit!

React & State Management: 🔄
Implementing the useState method in React made the task and theme management highly efficient, allowing for instant UI updates without lag.
State management ensures real-time interactivity, making task addition/removal or theme toggling immediate.

Modern Aesthetic: 💻
Whether you prefer a vibrant dark look or a clear light mode, this app brings out the best of both worlds, ensuring it looks sleek, professional, and enjoyable to use.

🎯 Project Goals:
To create a highly functional task manager that helps users stay on top of their tasks while giving them control over how the interface looks and feels.
Prioritize a responsive and accessible interface for all users, ensuring ease of use across devices and environments.

🌐 Technologies Used:
React for building the app interface
CSS for styling and responsiveness
JavaScript for interactivity and logic
useState Hook for managing state (tasks and theme preferences)
